<h3>Tips and Common Problems<br>
</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Filtering in the background:</span>
When Outlook is under load, SpamBayes may occasionally miss some
messages (as Outlook doesn't tell us they appeared), and if you use
builtin Outlook rules, you may find that occasionally they also
fail to filter messages (as both SpamBayes and Outlook
"fight" over processing the message).&nbsp; To overcome these problems,
SpamBayes defaults to filtering new messages in the background.&nbsp;
The enabling or disabling of this feature, and the delay before
processing new mails can be configured via the SpamBayes Manager's <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Advanced</span>
tab. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Toolbars stop working:</span> Many
people report that occasionally the toolbars will stop working.&nbsp;
See the <a href="docs/troubleshooting.html">troubleshooting guide</a>
for more details on how to fix this.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Toolbars remain after uninstall:</span>
If you uninstall SpamBayes, the toolbar items will remain when you next
start Outlook.&nbsp; You can delete the toolbar by right-clicking on
it, then selecting Customize.&nbsp; Our <a
 href="docs/troubleshooting.html">troubleshooting guide</a> has alot
more information on toolbars.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Late Breaking Problems:</span> For
problems reported since this version of SpamBayes was released, see the
online <a
 href="http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/apps/outlook/bugs.html">frequently
reported bugs list</a>.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="Field"></a>Viewing and Using the Spam Score Field</h3>
A custom property named <span style="font-style: italic;">Spam</span>
is added to all Outlook messages scored, but Outlook does not allow us
to automatically add this to your views.&nbsp; However, you can teach
Outlook to
display this field as a column in any table view, like the standard
Messages view.
<p> This takes some work, and has to be done again for every folder in
which you want to display a Spam column - typically this will be all
folders you are filtering, and your Spam and Unsure folders.&nbsp;
Perform the following steps<br>
</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" border="0"
 style="text-align: left; width: 100%;">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">
      <ul>
        <li>While looking at an Outlook table view (like Messages),
right-click on the line with column headers (From, Subject, To,
Received, ...). In the context menu that pops up, click on Field
Chooser. A box with title <i>Field Chooser</i> pops up.</li>
        <li>In the drop-down list at the top of the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Field Chooser</span> window, select <span
 style="font-style: italic;">User Defined Fields</span></li>
        <li>Below the drop-down, you should see a rectangular
button with a <span style="font-style: italic;">Spam</span> label .
This<span style="font-style: italic;"></span> should be automatically
created for
all folders managed by the system, but if it does not appear, you will
need to add it yourself. &nbsp;To do this, perform the following steps</li>
        <ul>
          <li>In the lower left corner of the <i>Field Chooser</i>
box,
click <i>New...</i>. A box with title <i>New Field</i> pops up. </li>
          <li>In the <i>Name:</i> box, type Spam. </li>
          <li>In the <i>Type:</i> dropdown list, select <i>Percent</i>.
This is the third choice in the dropdown list. Do not
select any other format -- it won't work. </li>
          <li>The <i>Format:</i> select the first entry in the list -
"Rounded".&nbsp; The Field Chooser should now look like the first image
on the right.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Click OK in the <i>New Field</i> box. Now you're back in
the <i>Field Chooser</i> box, with a new <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Spam</span> button shown, as the second
figure shows.<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Use your mouse to drag the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Spam</span> button to the column header
position where you want to see the Spam column. You don't have to be
precise here -- you can rearrange or resize the column later just by
dragging it around. </li>
        <li>You're done! Close the <i>Field Chooser</i> box.</li>
      </ul>

<ul>
</ul>
Outlook's standard Automatic Formatting features can also be taught how
to access the value of this field; for example, you could tell Outlook
to display rows with suspected spam messages in green italic. However,
for whatever reason, the Outlook Rules Wizard does not allow creating
rules based on user-defined fields. That's why this addin supplies its
own filtering rules.<br>
<h2>Installing for all users on a machine</h2>
By default, SpamBayes will install itself only for the user who
actually installed it.&nbsp; If other users log onto the same machine,
their Outlook installation will not have SpamBayes available.&nbsp;
Even though this is the way SpamBayes is designed, our troubleshooting
guide has <a href="docs/troubleshooting.html#register-all-users">details
on how you can change this</a>.<br>
