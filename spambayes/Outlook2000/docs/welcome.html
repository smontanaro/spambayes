<h1>Welcome to SpamBayes</h1>
<p>SpamBayes is an Outlook plugin that provides a spam filter based on
statistical analysis of
your personal mail. Unlike many other spam detection systems,
SpamBayes
actually learns what you consider spam, and continually adapts as both
your regular email and spam patterns change.</p>
<p>When you first start Outlook after SpamBayes has been installed, the
SpamBayes Installation Wizard will appear. This Wizard will guide
you through the configuration process and allow you to quickly have
SpamBayes filtering your mail. This document contains additional
information which will help make SpamBayes effective from the first
time you use it.</p>
<p>Please remember that this is free software; please be patient, and
note that there are plenty of things to improve. There are ways
you can help, even if you aren't a programmer - you could help with
this documentation, or <a
 href="http://www.spambayes.org/donations.html">make a donation</a>, or
any number of other ways - please see the <a
 href="http://www.spambayes.org">main project
page</a> for information. The list of <a
 href="http://www.spambayes.org/faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a>
may also answer some of yours.</p>

the documentation, see <a href="../About.html">About SpamBayes</a>.</p>
<h3>Training</h3>
SpamBayes has no builtin
rules, so anything you consider spam will be treated as spam by this
system, even if it does not conform to the traditional definitions of
spam. This means that SpamBayes requires <span
 style="font-style: italic;">training </span>before it will be
effective. There are two ways that this training can be done:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Allow SpamBayes to learn as it goes. Initially, SpamBayes
will consider all mail items <span style="font-style: italic;">unsure</span>,
and each item will be used to
train. In this scenario, SpamBayes will take some time to become
effective. It will rarely make mistakes, but will continue to be
unsure about items until the training information grows.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Pre-sorting mail into two folders; one containing only examples
of good messages, and another containing only examples of spam.
SpamBayes will then process all these messages gathering the clues it
uses to filter mail. Depending on how many messages you train
on, SpamBayes will be immediately effective at correctly classifying
your mail.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Installation Wizard will guide you through these options.</p>
<p>It is important to note that even when SpamBayes has little training
information, it rarely gets things wrong - the worst it generally does
is to classify a message as <span style="font-style: italic;">unsure</span>.
However, as mentioned, the more training information SpamBayes has, the
less it is unsure about new messages. See using the plugin below
for more information.</p>
<h3>Using the Plugin</h3>
<img alt="SpamBayes Toolbar" style="float:right; margin: 1em" src="images/manager-select.jpg" />
<p>This section describes how the
plugin operates once it is configured.
You can access the SpamBayes features from the SpamBayes toolbar (shown
to the right), but
in general, SpamBayes will simply and silently filter your mail.</p>
<p>As messages arrive, they are given a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">spam score</span>. This score is
the measure of how "spammy" the system has decided a mail is, with 100%
being certain spam, and 0% meaning the message is certainly not
spam. The SpamBayes addin uses these scores to classify mail into
one of three categories -
<span style="font-style: italic;">certain spam</span>, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">unsure</span>, and good messages.
Good messages are often
known in the anti-spam community as <span style="font-style: italic;">ham</span>.</p>
<p>Mail that is classified as good is never touched by this plugin -
they
will remain in your inbox, or be filtered normally by Outlook's builtin
rules. Mail that is classified as either <span
 style="font-style: italic;">unsure</span> or <span
 style="font-style: italic;">certain spam</span>
is moved into different folders for future review.</p>
<p>Outlook does not allow us to automatically add the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">spam score</span> to your Outlook folder
views - but you can <a href="../about.html#Field">do it
manually by following these instructions</a>.<br/>
</p>
There are three ways in which the system can get things wrong:
<ul>
  <li>A spam stays in your inbox. This is known as a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">false negative</span>. In this case
you can either drag the message to the Spam folder or click on the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Delete as Spam</span> button on the
Outlook
toolbar. In both cases, the message will be trained as spam and
will be moved to the spam folder.</li>
  <li>Any message is moved to the unsure folder. In this case,
the system is simply unsure about the message, and moves it to the
possible spam folder for human review. All unsure messages should
be manually classified; good messages can either be dragged back to the
inbox, or have the <span style="font-style: italic;">Recover from Spam</span>
toolbar button clicked, while spam messages can either be dragged to
the
Spam folder or have the <span style="font-style: italic;">Delete as
Spam</span>
toolbar button (shown above) clicked. In all cases, the system
will
automatically
be trained appropriately.</li>
  <li>A wanted (ham) message is moved to the Spam folder. This is known
as a <span style="font-style: italic;">false positive</span>. In
this case you can either drag the message back to the folder from which
it came (generally the inbox), or click on the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Recover from Spam</span> button. In
both cases the message will be trained as good, and moved back to the
original folder.</li>
</ul>
Note that in all cases, as you take corrective action on the mail, the
system is also trained. This makes it less likely that another
similar mail will be incorrectly classified in the future.<br/>
