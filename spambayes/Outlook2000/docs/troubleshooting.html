<h1>Troubleshooting the SpamBayes Outlook addin</h1>
This is a list of common problems, and hopefully their solutions.&nbsp;
Please feel free to suggest additional topics.&nbsp; Currently, we have
the following problems listed:<br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#NoToolbar">Toolbar items appear, but fail to work</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Error_during_load">Addin loads with an error message</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Addin_doesnt_load">Addin doesn't load</a></li>

users on the machine</a><br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="#All_other_problems">All other problems</a></li>
</ul>
There is also an <a href="http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/faq.html">online
FAQ for SpamBayes</a> which may have additional information of
use.&nbsp; You may also wish to see the <a
 href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/spambayes/spambayes/Outlook2000/docs/troubleshooting.html?rev=HEAD">latest
online version of this document</a> for problems added since
release.&nbsp; If you must send someone a mail about SpamBayes, <a
 href="#mail">please read this first</a>.<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2><a name="NoToolbar"></a>Toolbar items appear, but fail to work</h2>
If the toolbar items fail to work, we are facing one of two problems.<br>
<ul>
  <li>The addin has failed to load.&nbsp; In this case, along with the
toolbars failing to work, SpamBayes will not be filtering or scoring
any messages.&nbsp; To fix this, see the <a href="#Addin_doesnt_load">Addin
doesn't load instructions</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>If the addin has loaded (ie, is filtering and scoring mail) but
the toolbar items don't, we have struck a common problem with the
toolbars.&nbsp; Follow the instructions below.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
First we will try deleting the toolbar, and if that fails, completely
reset all Outlook toolbars.&nbsp; Perform the following steps.<br>
<ul>
  <li>Right-click on any Outlook toolbar, and select Customize.</li>
  <li>In the dialog that appears, ensure the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Toolbars</span> tab is selected, locate
SpamBayes in the list of
toolbars, and select it.</li>
  <li>Click on the Delete button.&nbsp; Outlook will ask for
confirmation that you want to delete the SpamBayes toolbar.&nbsp;
Select OK.</li>
  <li>Close the customize dialog.&nbsp; The SpamBayes toolbar no longer
appear.</li>
  <li>Restart Outlook.&nbsp; SpamBayes will re-create the toolbar.</li>
</ul>
If all else fails, you can completely reset the Outlook toolbars by
removing the file <span style="font-style: italic;">\Documents and
Settings\{username}\Application Data\Microsoft\Outlook\outcmd.dat</span>.&nbsp;
Although this is undocumented by Microsoft, we have never heard reports
of problems.&nbsp; If you are paranoid, simply rename this file so that
you have a copy.&nbsp; This has solved all toolbar problems for
everyone who has reported one!<br>
<h2><a name="Error_during_load"></a>Addin loads with an error message</h2>
In this case, when you start Outlook you receive a message indicating
that SpamBayes could not be initialized.<br>
This means that SpamBayes has loaded, but struck an error during
initialization.&nbsp; If the information in the error message does not
indicate the nature of the error, please <a href="#ReportABug">report
a bug</a> (making sure you <a href="#CheckLog">attach the log file</a>)<br>
<h2><a name="Addin_doesnt_load"></a>Addin doesn't load</h2>
If you start Outlook but there was no error message, the SpamBayes
toolbar items do not work and new messages have no Spam score or
filtering applied, then the plugin has probably become disabled.<br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#CheckLog">Check the log file</a>.&nbsp; If a log file
for this session exists, then see if it contains an error.&nbsp; If
not, check the date and time of the log - it is probably a log from the
last time it did work, so is no help to us.&nbsp; If a log does exist,
please <a href="#ReportABug">report a bug.</a><br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Check that Outlook shows the addin as enabled.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>Start Outlook, and select <span style="font-style: italic;">Tools</span>-&gt;<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Options</span> to display the main Options
dialog.</li>
    <li>Select the tab labeled <span style="font-style: italic;">Other</span>,
then click on the <span style="font-style: italic;">Advanced</span>
button.</li>
    <li>Click on the <span style="font-style: italic;">COM Add-Ins</span>
button.</li>
    <li>If the SpamBayes addin is not listed, then SpamBayes should be
reinstalled (Note that running <span style="font-style: italic;">regsvr32.exe
outlook_addin.dll</span> from the SpamBayes directory may also solve
this problem)</li>
    <li>If the SpamBayes addin is listed but not checked, then simply
check it and close the dialog.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>If you are running <span style="font-weight: bold;">Outlook 2002</span>,
you may find that if you go back to the dialog, the addin will still be
unselected.&nbsp; In this case, perform the following:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>Go to <span style="font-style: italic;">Help-&gt;About
Microsoft Outlook</span>.&nbsp; <br>
    </li>
    <li>Click the Disabled Items button. <br>
    </li>
    <li>Select SpamBayes.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Click Enable.</li>
    <li>Restart Outlook 2002.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
If you are running from source code, the addin will not appear in the
above steps.&nbsp; Please re-register the
addin, as per the README.txt file.
<ul>
</ul>
If none of that works, I am stumped!
<ol>
  <ol>
  </ol>
</ol>
<ul>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Messages_fail_to_filter"></a>Messages fail to filter</h2>
This is when messages arrive, but have no <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Spam</span> field.&nbsp; Note that this is
different from a message having an incorrect or unexpected Spam value -
that case is covered next.&nbsp; This is for messages that have a
completely blank spam score.&nbsp; To resolve this:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Check that filtering is enabled.&nbsp; Select the SpamBayes
manager, then ensure the button Enable Filtering is checked.&nbsp; If
you are unable to select this button due to insufficient training
information, please review the <a
 href="../about.html##Installing_and_Configuring">initial configuration
documentation for information on training</a>.</li>
  <li>If only the occasional message fails to filter, then it is likely
that the message is in a format we don't understand.&nbsp; There is
almost certainly an error listed in the log file.&nbsp; Please <a
 href="#ReportABug">report a bug</a>, attaching both the <a
 href="#CheckLog">log file</a> and the message that caused the error.</li>
  <li>If all messages fail to filter, we have a more serious problem,
but again, please <a href="#ReportABug">report
a bug</a>, attaching the <a href="#CheckLog">log
file.</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Messages_have_incorrect_or_unexpected"></a>Messages have
incorrect or unexpected Spam values</h2>
This is when filtering appears to work OK, except that the spam values
are wrong.&nbsp; To resolve this<br>
<ul>
  <li>If the messages are all scoring as "unsure", with a score of 0.5,
then you may have lost your training database.&nbsp; From the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">SpamBayes manager </span>dropdown, check
how many spam and ham have been loaded by the system.&nbsp; If this
number is very low (like zero!) then you probably need to perform a
full
re-train of your database.</li>
  <li>If the messages have apparently random, but unexpected scores,
then there are two possibilities; either SpamBayes is simply behaving
what appears to be strangely, but really is correctly, or that some of
the spam payload is invisible to SpamBayes.&nbsp; In both cases,
perform
the following:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure the message is selected in the Outlook preview pane, and
from the <span style="font-style: italic;">SpamBayes manager</span>
dropdown, select <span style="font-style: italic;">Show Spam clues for
current message</span>.&nbsp; This should open a new mail message with
the clues.</li>
    <li>Part of the clues shows the body of the spam message.&nbsp; If
this message correctly shows the spam text, then it is likely SpamBayes
is behaving correctly.&nbsp; In this case, you may wish to mail the
clues to the SpamBayes mailing list for help in decoding the clues, but
it is likely that SpamBayes is behaving correctly given your current
training data.<br>
    </li>
    <li>If it appears that part of the spam payload is missing, then
you have probably stumbled across a bug - please mail the clues to the
mailing list.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2><a name="register-all-users"></a>SpamBayes is not available for all
users on the machine.</h2>
When SpamBayes is installed, by default it is available only for the
user who installed it.&nbsp; This is to allow SpamBayes to appear in
Microsoft Outlook's Com-Addin list, and therefore able to be activated
and de-activated by the user inside Outlook.<br>
It is possible to register the addin so it is available to all users on
a particular machine, which can be useful in enterprise arrangements
where users have 'roaming profiles'<br>
To register SpamBayes in this way, you must execute the command
(obviously with the correct patch substituted):<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regsvr32.exe
/i:hkey_local_machine "c:\Program Files\SpamBayes\bin\outlook_addin.dll"</span><br>
If you <a href="#CheckLog">check the installation log</a> after
performing such an install, you should see the following messages:<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Registered:
SpamBayes.OutlookAddin </span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Registration
complete.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Registration (in
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE) complete.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
Note the last line, which does not exist when registration is performed
only for the current user.&nbsp; Once you have performed this
registration, the Addin will be available for all users - but as noted
above, it will no longer appear in Outlook's Com-Addin list.<br>
<h2><a name="All_other_problems"></a>All other problems</h2>
If you are simply unsure about what SpamBayes is doing, please <a
 href="#mail">send a
mail to the </a><a href="#mail">SpamBayes mailing
list</a>
with as much information as possible.&nbsp; If you are fairly sure you
have struck a bug, then please <a href="#ReportABug">report it</a>.&nbsp;
Please do not mail any of the contributors directly.<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2>Process Descriptions<br>
</h2>
This explains some of the processes above in more detail.<br>
<h3><a name="InstallationType"></a>Determine your installation type.</h3>
If you are running from Python source code, and installed Python, plus
SpamBayes as separate components, then you are running the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">source code version</span>.&nbsp; If you
downloaded an installer .EXE file, then you are running the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">binary version</span>.<br>
<h3><a name="CheckLog"></a>Check the log file</h3>
<a href="#InstallationType">Determine your installation type</a>.&nbsp;
If you are running the source code version, then please see README.txt
in the Outlook2000 directory.<br>
If you are running the binary version, then the SpamBayes addin writes
a log in your Windows temp directory.&nbsp; This directory is generally
<span style="font-style: italic;">\WINDOWS\TEMP</span> for Windows 9x,
or <span style="font-style: italic;">\Documents and
Settings\{username}\Local
Settings\Temp</span> for Windows 2000/XP.<br>
<br>
Note that by default, in Windows 2000 and XP, Windows Explorer will not
show the <span style="font-style: italic;">Local Settings</span>
directory, as it is hidden.&nbsp; You can convince Windows Explorer to
show this directory (and therefore allow you to see the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Temp</span> directory under it by doing
either:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Select the folder <span style="font-style: italic;">\Documents
and Settings\{username}</span>.&nbsp; This directory should be
reflected in the Address Bar.&nbsp; In the Address Bar, simply type at
the end "\Local Settings" (thereby giving that full path name), and
press <span style="font-style: italic;">Enter</span>.&nbsp; Explorer
will then show this folder.</li>
</ul>
or
<ul>
  <li>Select <span style="font-style: italic;">Tools-&gt;Folder Options</span>,
select the <span style="font-style: italic;">View</span> tab, and in
the list, select <span style="font-style: italic;">Show hidden files
and folders</span>.&nbsp; Select OK.&nbsp; This folder will now be
visible.&nbsp; You may like to then reset this option back to the
default value.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
The log file for the
most recent execution of Outlook is named <span
 style="font-style: italic;">spambayes1.log</span>, the second most
recent is named <span style="font-style: italic;">spambayes2.log</span>,
and so on for the four previous runs.&nbsp; You can view this file with
notepad.&nbsp; Usually, you will simply see
messages which indicate that SpamBayes is doing its job; however
in some cases there will be errors in this file.&nbsp; If there are
errors, please <a href="#ReportABug">report a bug</a>.<br>
<h4>If the log file is very large</h4>
This probably means that SpamBayes failed to process a large number of
(or a few, large) emails.&nbsp; In that case, please perform the
following steps:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure all messages in your watch folders are marked as read</li>
  <li>Restart Outlook (use <span style="font-style: italic;">Exit and
Sign off</span> if it is in your <span style="font-style: italic;">File</span>
menu)</li>
  <li>Send yourself a test message, and wait for it to arrive.</li>
  <li>Exit Outlook.</li>
</ul>
You should have a new log file containing the error when classifying
the test message.&nbsp; If no error occurs processing the test message,
the previous large log file will still exist (see above).&nbsp; Either
edit the file using a text editor to extract just the error
information, or zip it up.&nbsp; If you don't know what that means,
please send a mail.<br>
