Tony Meyer        12/01/2004  Path/file options are no longer relative to the current working directory, they are relative to the last configuration file loaded.

Tony Meyer        11/01/2004  mkgraph.py: Modify the outputing so that it can be in different formats for those of us without plotmtv.  The -c command line option outputs all the lines in the same set of rows, rather than in their own set as is the default.  The -s arg specifies the separator for this sort of output (defaults to a comma, so that csv files are output).
Tony Meyer        11/01/2004  incremental.py: Add a docstring and the ability to print it with -h or --help to incremental.py

Tony Meyer        31/12/2003  pop3dnd: Start our UIDs at 1, not 0, because Eudora likes this more.
Tony Meyer        31/12/2003  pop3dnd: Don't override the imported name "message".
Tony Meyer        31/12/2003  pop3dnd: Add a new folder - INBOX - this holds any messages from SpamBayes to the user. (Having INBOX as an alias for Spam wasn't working well, and being able to communicate within the confines of the mailer is nice, too).
Tony Meyer        31/12/2003  pop3dnd: Don't let the user set so much via the command line.  Use a config file, you lazy person.
Tony Meyer        31/12/2003  pop3proxy_tray: When we stopped sb_server and then restarted, we didn't init the state, so it wouldn't work.  Fix that.

Tony Meyer        29/12/2003  Web interface: Improve the 'online' help message for the review page, and add messages for the stats and home pages.
Tim Peters        29/12/2003  Many improvements to the mksets.py testtools script.
Tim Peters        28/12/2003  sort+group.py: Sort msgs by full-precision timestamp (not just by day).  Normalize Received time to UTC first.  Use email.Utils to parse dates instead of hand-rolling our own parser

Tim Peters        28/12/2003  Outlook: export.py - the -n option now gives the number of Set subdirectories desired, instead of a number of msgs per Set subdir "to shoot for".
Tim Peters        28/12/2003  Added a new -t option to rebal.py, may have broken -s and -r options.
Tim Peters        26/12/2003  Many improvements to the rebal.py testtools script.
